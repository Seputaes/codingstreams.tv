[codingstreams.tv](https://codingstreams.tv) is a website for collecting and showcasing live streamers
who regularly or otherwise stream live coding, programming, or related content. The streamers are primarily
sourced from the [Awesome Developer Streams](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams) curated list,
but has diverged in some areas. codingstreams.tv has no affiliation with this separate project.

## Adding or Modifying a Streamer

[Awesome Developer Streams](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-developer-streams) GibHub project, and this repo
